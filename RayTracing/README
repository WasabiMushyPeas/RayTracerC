# RayTracerC

This is a C implementation of a ray tracer, a program that simulates the behavior of light in a virtual 3D environment. The goal of this project is to generate realistic images by tracing the path of light rays as they interact with objects in the scene.

## Features

- Support for rendering basic geometric shapes such as spheres, planes, and triangles.
- Implementation of various lighting models, including diffuse, specular, and ambient lighting.
- Support for shadows and reflections.
- Ability to render scenes with multiple objects and light sources.
- Customizable camera settings, such as field of view and depth of field.
